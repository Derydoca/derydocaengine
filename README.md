# Derydoca Engine

I have tinkered around with creating little 3D rendering applications here and there over my years, but now I am spending time to build a game engine from scratch. This is an experiment for me to develop in the open and allow the world to see my code evolve. This is a project for me to learn from but I welcome any and everyone to look through my code and learn from me.

## Development Environment

This is being written in Visual Studio 2017. For anyone who wants to use another compiler, feel free to, however it will be simplest to use the most recent version of Visual Studio.

## Third Party Libraries

*  GLEW - For exposing OpenGL functions
*  SDL2 - For window management
*  GLM - For all the complex math made to make games
*  SOIL - For image loading
*  yaml-cpp - For configuration files and serialized levels
